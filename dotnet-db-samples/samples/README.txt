ODP.NET, Managed Driver Code Samples
====================================
You must have managed ODP.NET installed. To run the samples, follow these directions:
1) Modify the Data Source attribute in the connection strings to connect to an Oracle database via Easy Connect, TNS connect descriptor, or TNS alias.
2) Most of these samples use the SCOTT schema. The create scripts for SCOTT schema are located here: https://github.com/oracle/dotnet-db-samples/tree/master/schemas
3) Add Oracle.ManagedDataAccess.dll to the sample application.
4) Read <GitHub .NET samples directory>\doc\Readme.html, if any. 

While these samples are designed for managed ODP.NET, they can use unmanaged ODP.NET by incorporating Oracle.DataAccess.dll and adding the correct namespace references (i.e. using Oracle.DataAccess.Client; using Oracle.DataAccess.Types;).

Below is a list of topics that the samples cover:
